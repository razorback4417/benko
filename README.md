"benko" comes from the ["Benko Gambit"](https://www.chess.com/openings/Benko-Gambit), a popular opening for black where the player sacrifices material for long-term positional compensation.

inspo includes Avalanche's recent [partnership](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/the-international-chess-federation-brings-chess-into-web3-on-avalanche-5720f9ceb23) with International Chess Federation (FIDE), and Algorand's [partnership](https://www.algorand.com/first-digital-chess-game-ranked-on-blockchain) with FIDE 2 years ago.

overall, benko aims to combine blockchain gaming practices with Gitcoin's public good ideology, starting with the use case of chess.

code uses open source chess.js, and intends to later implement features similar to https://anichess.com/ and https://treasure.chess.com/
